<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<p>We make ourselves a place apart<br>
    &nbsp Behind light word sthat tease and flout.<br>
But oh, the agitated heart<br>
    &nbsp Till someone find us really out.<br>
</p>

<p>'Tis pity if the case require<br>
    &nbsp(or so we say) that in the end<br>
We speak the ltieral to inspire<br>
    &nbspThe understanding of a friend.<br>
</p>
<p>
But so with all, from babes that play<br>
    &nbsp at hide-and-seek to God afar,<br>
So all who hide too well away<br>
    &nbsp Must speak and tell us there they are.<br>
</p>
